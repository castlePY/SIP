PROJECT : Iprovements over SIP (Session Inititation Protocol)

The purpose of this project was to design and implement 3 new functionalities 
in the application combining a client program, SIP Commmunicator, and a 
serving program, Jain SIP Proxy. Those 2 programs implement the protocol SIP,
which is defined under the RFC 3261[1], which was published by the organization
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The SIP Protocol allows 
the evolution of communication applications through Internet, amongst them
the service of Voice over IP (VoIP), which is used for Skype.

RFC Link : http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt
Initial Package : https://jsip.ci.cloudbees.com/job/jsip/ws/


-----------------------Initial Package-----------------------------

The initial package was an implementetion of Sip Communicator
and Sip Proxy Server. Logging in without authentication was allowed
from Sip Communicator to Proxy Server. After the registration, each
Sip Communicator could make call (including voice and image), to any
other Sip Communicator that was registered to the same Proxy Server


-----------------------Improvements---------------------------------

The improvements implemented over the pre-existing package included
the following 4 features :
- Authentication (single registration - multiple logins)
- Blocking 
- Forwarding 
- Billing
- Friending | Unfriending

[Authentication]
User is required to have made at least a registration to the Proxy Server 
prior to logging. The info given during the registration are the username,
the password, the email and the address of the user. If the user has not 
made any registration prior to the attempt to login, he is not allowed 
to login. Similarly, if the user gives a wrong password, he is not 
allowed to login to the application.

[Blocking]
User can block other users, so that they cannot make a call to him.
If a blocked user attempts a call to his blockee, he will see that 
the other user is blocked, so that he will not be able to 
understand that the other user blocked him. With the corresponding
button in the menu the user can see all the users that he has blocked.

[Forwarding]
A user can forward all the calls to another user. In this way,
whoever calls this user, will make a call to the user this call 
was forwarded to. It is also implemented an additional feature, 
so that the circular forwardings are not allowed and the procedure
of forwarding is stopped in the last user before a circle is 
completed.

[Billing]
Each user is charged for each call made to another user.
The calls are charged linearly dependent on the duration
of the call and there is also a level, under which the users
are charged with constant cost.
Also, different charges occur between friends (see next).
With the corresponding button in the menu, the user can see
the total cost of all the calls he has made.

[Friending]
Each user can friend another user. This functionality
is mutual, so if user A friends user B, the B will not 
need to acknoledge the friendship.
Each of the 2 users can unfriend the other in order to 
stop this relationship between them. 2 users that are friended 
benefit from lower charges during their calls.
With the corresponding button in the menu, the user can see
all his current friends.

-----------------------EXECUTION--------------------------------
In order to execute this package, the instructions that have to be followed are
the following :

- Installation of Java SE 7u7 JDK

Install the corresponding Java for our Operating System from 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

- Installation of the environment Java Media Framework

Download JMF 2.1.1e Software for our specific environment from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/download-142937.html

- Update environment variable PATH

We insert the 2 following paths in the variable PATH:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_07\bin;
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_07\jre;
where those are the paths of Java Installation

- Installation of Eclipse

- Download of the package form Github (folder SipProject)

- Start Eclipse 

Choose as workspace the path (C:\SipProject\workspace)

- Import Sip Communicator and Proxy Server

Choose form upper meny of eclipse
File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace 
-> Next -> (Browse) -> C:\SipProject and select 
Sip Communicator and Proxy Server 

- Installation of mySQL - Configuration
You should have installed the mySQL in your PC, and you should
go in the class gov.nist.sip.proxy.Database.java to update
your own credentials. Also, you may need to re-import the 
mysql-connector jar from the folder SipProject\sipproxy\lib. This
is done by right-clicking in sipproxy in eclipse and then
Configure Build Path -> Add External Jar -> browse to the file

- Configuration files of Communicator
You must set the following attributes in the file sip-communicator.xml:
<AUDIO_PORT value="22224"/>
<VIDEO_PORT value="22222"/>
<REGISTRAR_ADDRESS value="<ip of Proxy Server>:4000"/>
<REGISTRAR_PORT value="5060"/>
<DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME value="<ip of Proxy Server>:4000"/>
<DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_REALM value="<ip of Proxy Server>:4000"/>
<IP_ADDRESS value="<ip of Communicator>"/>
<OUTBOUND_PROXY value="<ip of Proxy Server>:4000/udp"/>

You must also set the following attributes in the file configuration.xml of Proxy Server
stack_IP_address="<ip of Proxy Server>"

- Run of Proxy Server 

We choose at class gov.nist.sip.proxy.gui.ProxyLauncher.java the option
Run As -> Java Application -> New and add the following as Argument :
â€“cf gov/nist/sip/proxy/configuration/configuration.xml

- Run of Sip Communicator 

We choose at class net.java.sip.communicator.SipCommunicator.java the option 
Run As -> Java Application -> New and add the following as VM Argument :
-Djava.library.path=./lib

-  Start the proxy

We press the button Start the Proxy in Proxy Server
We also press Register from Sip Communicator 

- Here we are ready !!!
